# Foundational models
- With FMs, instead of gathering labeled data for each model and training multiple models as in traditional ML, you can adapt a single FM to perform multiple tasks. These tasks include text generation, text summarization, information extraction, image generation, chatbot interactions, and question answering. FMs can also serve as the starting point for developing more specialized models.

## Foundation Model Lifecycle 
1. Data Collection : Massive Unlabeled data (e.g. Images,Video, text off internet)
2. Pre-training : self-supervised learning (i.e. generating context and associations based on Self-supervised learning makes use of the structure within the data to autogenerate labels)
3. Optimization : a Foundational Model (FM) can be optiized for specific domains, using Prompt engineering, RAG, and Fine Tuning.
4. Evaluation : important for biz needs, regardless of a off-the shelf or Fine Tuned model. Can have different metrics and it's business dependant.
5. Deployment : APIs or embedded software
6. Monitoring and improvements : model drift (less accurate results over time with new data)
